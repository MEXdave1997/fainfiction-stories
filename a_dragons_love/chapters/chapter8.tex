It wasn't long after I had "passed out" that the girls woke me up from their floor. I honestly don't know what is wrong with me, and it annoys me to all hell and back. I mean, I'm going to be \textbf{King of the Harems} damn it! I should be able to view any girl in skimpy clothing and bask in all that glory!

\emph{Sigh.} Oh well, its not like it matters now anyway.

Once I recovered, we had all gone beachside and had just a day off out in the beach with the sun. As I was lounging on the beach, watching the girls splash around near the water, I hear my name coming from my right side.

I look over a bit out of the corner of my eye, and find Rias there, lying on her stomach, a bottle of sun-tan lotion in her hand.

"Oh, Issei?" she says, a smug , playfully seductive tone in her voice.

Goosebumps appeared on my skin, but not from fear or from cold. Rather, its more because she knows my all to well, and she is playing my horny nature like a fiddle.
