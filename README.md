# Stories Repository

Just a little repo for my Fanfictions, turned into ebooks for offline reading on an e-reader, phone, etc. Built using [LaTeX][1] and [VS-Code][2].

I will include my workspace settings for easy building within the Editor

## Building
1. [Install Visual Studio Code][3].
2. Follow the Instructions to Install the [LaTeX-Workshop Plugin][4], which can be found [here][5].
3. Go into the directory for the story of choice.
4. Press the Command Shortcut (`Shift+Control+P` on Windows), search for `LaTeX-Workshop: Build LaTeX Project`
5. Hit Enter, and the command should run

PDFs should be outputted in the `build/` directory for each story.


## Contact
If you have any questions, or have issues setting up the build, you can always submit a Pull Request, and I'll help to the best of my ability.
